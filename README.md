# DataGen
DataGen is an open-source random data generator. Many very well-built random data generators already exist, so why did I build my own? Because I thought that I could improve the design to suit my workflow specifically. 

## Intended use
The primary purpose of this tool is to open the web page and immediately have JSON data that you can copy directly into your IDE. There are some options for customizability, but the primary goal of the design is to keep the user's focus on the coding task. It's meant to be used as a side tab in the browser, where you switch to it for a few seconds, hit copy, then paste the data into the IDE.
